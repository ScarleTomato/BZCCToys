// StratStarting.txt - Vehicles possible to start with in strat/MPI
//
// Format of lines: unique identifier, space separator, odf filename, space
// separator, description Lines starting with // are ignored.
//
// NOTE: do not put .odf extension on odf filename; added automatically
// on loading
//
// Also, please remember that these vehicle names will be changed to
// the appropriate race at runtime, so make sure they exist across
// races -- for example, ivmbike has no scion counterpart (fvmbike).
// 
// Unlike MPVehicles.txt, there are no XSI names. You still need to
// have a unique identifier for the first part of the name, due to
// code reasons. No more than 32 craft can be listed here. Also, do
// *NOT* put more than 6 different types of units in here, as that'll
// exceed the F#-keys available in MPI. There's a 4-player limit on
// MPI, which means F8-F10 must be reserved for allies. With the
// recycler on F1, that means the rest of the groups must fit in
// F2..F6.
//
// The first 2 fields on each line must be 5 characters or longer, or
// the line will be ignored.
