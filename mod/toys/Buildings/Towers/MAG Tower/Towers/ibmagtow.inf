The first M.A.G. Tower requires no
power and no previous structures.
This idea came from the Shell gun
towers of the hadean fleet in the
FE mod, a good starting line of
defense without the need for power.
The next upgrade the MAGII requires
a bit of research and on up need
progressivley more power.
